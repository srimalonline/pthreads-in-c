# Thread Programming Simulation in C
A console application for simulating multi-threading programme in C language. 

## How to use this

1. Clone the code for your pc (Linux environment is best)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srimalonline/pthreads-in-c
cd pthreads-in-c
```
To know the correct execution time, I'm using **WSL** ubuntu environment with windows terminal.
So, You should use linux environment and install **gcc** package.

2. Compile the app using gcc (adding **-lpthread** is a must)

```bash
gcc app.c -lpthread
```
Then you just created an executable file named **a.out**

3. Run the executable file with time function.

```bash
time ./a.out
```
